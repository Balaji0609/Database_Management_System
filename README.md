# Database_Management_System
This project is focused towards learning on the internals of a database management system. 

Mini Base is a study purpose database management system that is focused on providing to students an hands on experience towards the database management system internals. The project is divided into three phases:

1) First phase deals with running a script and understanding the internal system and how the various parts of the system works.

2) In this phase we extend the mini base database system to support for Spatial data and also provide implementation for indexing the Spatial data using the R-Tree indexing technique.

3) In the final phase we implement range query, join query, select all query for the implemented Spatial data.
